To validate and apply the current ReaxFF description for the aluminum/oxygen system, two structures were prepared in this work: 504 Al atoms of Al (4 3 1) slab (1.40 Å~ 1.28 Å~ 4.82 nm, see Figure 1a) and 864 Al atoms of an amorphous Al cluster (diameter of 2.8 nm, see Figure 1b). The system configurations were displayed by the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) molecular graphics viewer, Visit, and Molden. The slab was built by cleaving the (4 3 1) plane of fcc-Al crystal and then by placing the slab in a 1.4 Å~ 1.28 Å~ 10.0 nm simulation box with 150 oxygen molecules. The amorphous cluster was obtained by annealing the fcc-Al crystal containing 864 Al atoms from 0 to 800 K for two cycles. Then, the annealed cluster was placed in the middle of a simulation box that measured 5.0 Å~ 5.0 Å~ 5.0 nm. Two different numbers of oxygen gas, that is, 300 and 600 oxygen  molecules, were distributed randomly in the simulation box with a periodic boundary condition, corresponding to oxygen gas densities of 0.13 and 0.26 g/cm3 , respectively. For the ReaxFF-MD simulations to deal with chemical reactions to occur smoothly, it has been reported that the time step needs to be lower than 1 order of the highest frequency of molecules (generally, t= 0.5 - 1.0 fs). In this study, the system temperature was controlled up to 900 K, and it was found that the time step of 0.2 fs efficiently describes the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion of oxygen molecules. Hence, all the simulations were performed with a time step of 0.2 fs and 5 000 000 iterations (up to 1.0 ns). Because this study was focused mainly on the oxidation of ANPs as a function of the temperature of the system, it was essential to control the temperature of the system during the MD simulations. For this reason, a canonical ensemble was used, that is, a constant number of atoms, constant volume, and constant temperature. In the canonical ensemble, a variety of thermostatic methods were used to control the temperature of the system, such as Nose36/Hoover, Berendsen, and Anderson. It has been suggested that the Nose/Hoover thermostat correctly describes the canonical ensemble with true dynamics, because such a method makes it possible to obtain a canonical distribution of the particlesÅf positions and momenta by using the extended Hamiltonian system. Hence, we chose to use the Nose/Hoover thermostat with a temperature damping constant of 100 fs implemented on the 29 Jan 2014 version of LAMMPS code (http://lammps.sandia.gov). In addition, the 864 atoms of the ANPs were heated from 0 to 1000 K with a heating rate of 0.02 K/fs to evaluate the melting temperature of the ANPs using the current ReaxFF description. The melting temperature of the 864 atoms of the ANPs is found to be about 800 K; the result is summarized in the Supporting Information.
