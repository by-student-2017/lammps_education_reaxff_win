# Compute elastic constant tensor for a crystal at finite temperature
#
# WARNING: This script attempts to measure small differences in 
# statistical averages generated by finite temperature MD simulations. 
# This creates many more opportunities for errors to occur, compared 
# to the zero temperature version provided in examples/ELASTIC.
# Hence, it is always a good idea to start with the zero temperature
# calculation, before attempting to use this script.
#
# Written by Aidan Thompson (Sandia, athomps@sandia.gov)
#
#  This script uses the following three include files.
#
#   init.mod      (must be modified for different crystal structures)
# 	       	  Define units, MD parameters, deformation parameters,
#		  and initial configuration of the atoms and simulation cell.  
#
#
#   potential.mod    (must be modified for different pair styles)
# 		     Define pair style and other attributes 
#		     not stored in restart file
#
#
#   displace.mod    (displace.mod should not need to be modified)
# 		    Perform positive and negative box displacements 
# 		    in direction ${dir} and size ${up}. 
# 		    It uses the resultant changes 
#		    in stress to compute one
# 		    row of the elastic stiffness tensor
#		    
#		    Inputs variables:
#		    	   dir = the Voigt deformation component 
#		    		    (1,2,3,4,5,6)  
#		    Global constants:
#       	    	   up = the deformation magnitude (strain units)
#       		   cfac = conversion from LAMMPS pressure units to 
#               	   output units for elastic constants 
#
#
#  To run this on a different system, it should only be necessary to 
#  modify the files init.mod and potential.mod. In order to calculate
#  the elastic constants correctly, care must be taken to specify
#  the correct units in init.mod (units, cfac and cunits). It is also
#  important to verify that the MD sampling of stress components
#  is generating accurate statistical averages.
#  One indication of this is that the elastic constants are insensitive
#  to the choice of the variable ${up} in init.mod. Another is to
#  check for finite size effects.
