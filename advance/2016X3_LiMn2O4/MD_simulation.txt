  The formation of the cathode electrolyte interface layer was simulated using a 
cathode half-cell composed of a LiMn2O4 crystal with its 100 surfaces exposed to the 
electrolyte consisting of 208 EC molecules, 480 DMC molecules, 36 FEC molecules and 
52 LiPF6 molecules. The LiMn2O4 crystal measuring 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm is located 
at the center of the simulation box with dimensions of 10.5 nm x 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm, the 
rest of the simulation box is filled with the electrolyte as shown in Figure 4.1. This 
configuration helps with maintaining periodic boundary conditions in all three directions 
without any discontinuities. Bulk electrolyte character is maintained at distances greater 
than 2 nm from the electrode surfaces even after 2 ns, the maximum time period in this 
study. The equilibrium electrolyte density in the simulation cell is 1.26 g/cc with 3:7 
mole ratio of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), 1M lithium 
hexafluorophosphate and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate. 
  The simulation cells were maintained at 330 K under the NVT ensemble using the 
Nose Hoover thermostat with a temperature rescaling constant of 10 fs. The starting 
configuration of the electrolyte molecules was generated using the PACKMOL code to 
make sure short range repulsive forces do not disrupt the simulation during the first time 
step. Each MD simulation was initiated from an energy-minimized structure and was 
equilibrated to the simulation temperature for 100 ps prior to the production run for 2 ns 
with a 0.2 fs time step.
  The fate of HF on the cathode surface was studied by running a duplicate 
simulation as described above and introducing HF molecules into the simulation after 1.5
ns of cathode electrolyte interface layer formation. The HF molecules were introduced at 
random locations within a distance of 10 Angstrom from the surface of the anode. HF molecules
are introduced into the cathode electrolyte interface layer at a rate of 0.5 molecules/ps 
with a total of 10 molecules introduced into the simulation cell. After the introduction of 
HF molecules, the simulations were run for an additional 500 ps. 
  The ReaxFF based MD simulations were implemented using the LAMMPS 
parallel molecular dynamics code. Molecular analysis of the simulations, to identify 
SEI layer compounds, were performed using a bond order cutoff of 0.2 as implemented 
in a home built MATLAB code.
