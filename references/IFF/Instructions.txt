1. In "MD_NAMD" folder
There are example IFF structural files (pdb and psf) of benzene and naphthalene at 
different surface coverage on Pt(111), corresponding to the 3-box method for 
calculating the heat of adsorption.

The configuration and parameter files for use with NAMD are also included.

2. In the "DFT_VASP" folder
There are cif files of the structures of calculating the heat of adsorption 
of benzene and naphthalene at different surface coverage on Pt(111),
corresponding to the 2-box method.

The typical INCAR file and KPOINT settings for use with VASP are also included.

3. In the "ReaxFF_LAMMPS" folder
There is an example of using ReaxFF to calculate the adsorption of benzene on Pt surface with a coverage of 0.1 ML. 

The data file and input file for LAMMPS program, along with the used force field file are included. 

4. In the "MOVIES" folder
There are two movies showing how the benzene and naphthalene molecules assemble on the Pt(111) surface at different surface coverages.
