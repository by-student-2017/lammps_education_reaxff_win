For ffield.reax.CHONSSiPtZrNiCuCoYBa series,
  The Ni/YSZ ReaxFF developed by combining the YSZ and Ni/C/H descriptions and defining  the missing angular terms from combination rules. Ni-Zr and Ni-Y bonded interactions were ignored; Ni/Y and Ni/Zr non-bonded parameters were obtained from combination rules.
