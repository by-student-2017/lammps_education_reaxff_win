  ReaxFF is a reactive molecular dynamics method that can describe connectivity changes smoothly, allowing for an accurate description of the chemical reactions entailed in bond formation and dissociation. The changes in the connectivity of particles are determined at every iteration step by bond orders that are calculated based on interatomic distances. Accordingly, valence and torsion angles, as well as chemical bonds, are treated properly, ensuring that their energy contributions disappear upon bond dissociation. In addition, nonbonded interactions such as van der Waals and Coulomb interactions are considered between particles, irrespective of connectivity. A detailed description of ReaxFF can be found elsewhere. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using ReaxFF, implemented in the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) package. In the irradiation simulations of He+, Ne+, Ar+, and Kr+ ions, graphene was described by the carbon parameters, which were developed from the ReaxFF C-2013 carbon parameters, and the repulsive interactions between graphene and ions were described by parameters that were optimized against a set of data obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark universal repulsive potential. The parametrization results (Figure S1), DFT settings, and force field parameters are provided in the Supporting Information.
  The periodic graphene sheet was constructed with approximate dimension of 52 x 40 Angstrom^2 and was fully equilibrated at 300 K by using a Nose-Hoover thermostat. Ions with the impact energy of 25 keV were irradiated within the center area (30 x 20 Angstrom^2) of graphene, and the periodic edges were kept at 300 K, playing the role of heat sink during MD simulations in a microcanonical ensemble (Figure S2). We note that the overall defects were generated within the irradiated region, and it was extremely rare to see collision of irradiation-induced carbon adatoms with the edge region where the temperature is controlled, indicating that the artifacts that might have originated from the simulation boundary conditions seemed to produce negligible effects on defect density. Extremely small time steps (0.005, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 fs for He+, Ne+, Ar+, and Kr+ irradiations, respectively) were used to ensure the conservation of energy during the high-energy impacts. Note that the dose rates in the simulations could not be matched to the ones in the experiments, due to computational limits. Therefore, in order to avoid any artifacts that may arise in the simulations due to the use of different dose rates, we carefully chose the dose rates of 1027, 5 x 1025, 3.5 x 1025, and 2.4 x 1025 ions/cm^2-s for He+, Ne+, Ar+, and Kr+ irradiations, respectively, which allowed a long enough time for the termination of cascade collisions between the impacts of each ion.
  In He+ irradiation simulations, the graphene structures were extracted after impacts of 1015, 1016, and 1017 ions/cm^2. Each irradiated graphene structure was first annealed at 1500 K for a short time (25 ps) and cooled to 300 K to eliminate any unrealistic configurations. In order to allow more complete reconstruction of the defects, which may occur near room temperature in experiments but not during molecular dynamics time scale, a subsequent annealing was performed at 2000 K for a longer period (1.25 ns). A comparison of the structures before and after the annealing processes are discussed below.
  In all other irradiation simulations (Ne+, Ar+, and Kr+), the irradiated graphene structures were collected after the impacts from fewer doses (1014, 1015, 2 x 1015 ions/cm^2) since they were much more destructive compared to the He+ ions, due to larger collision cross sections. The graphene structures were initially annealed at 1500 K for 25 ps, in the same manner as the He irradiation simulations, but a subsequent longer annealing was performed at a higher temperature (3000 K) to accelerate relaxation of the graphene structures with higher densities of vacancy-type defects. Note that monovacancy defects are known to be mobile, even at slightly above room temperature. However, the time scales for the diffusion of monovacancy defects at near room temperatures are not achievable in atomistic simulations. Therefore, a high temperature (3000 K) was used in the annealing.

  Deposition simulations via MD were conducted using the velocity Verlet algorithm [32] with a corresponding time step of 1 fs. Periodic boundaries were implemented in the x and y directions along with a fixed bottom ZnO layer to emulate a large ZnO slab. A Berendsen thermostat [33] is used for temperature control applied to the second and third double ZnO layers. The simulation cells used for the polar and non-polar ZnO surfaces were of similar volume, namely 22.80 x 26.33 x 30 Angstrom (with 512 atoms) for ZnO (0001) and 26.51 x 26.33 x 30 Angstrom (with 640 atoms) for ZnO (1010).

  The ReaxFF force fields from ref 38 have been used to simulate ZIF-4, ZIF-62, and ZIF-77 using LAMMPS. A timestep of 0.25 fs is used for time integration. The initial configurations of ZIF-4, ZIF-62, and ZIF-77 crystals are extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and are equilibrated at 10 K using a Berendsen thermostat. ZIF-4 and ZIF-62 are then heated to 300 K in 2.5 ps with the temperature and pressure controlled using a Nose-Hoover thermostat/barostat in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT), followed by further heating to 1500 K within 12.5 ps for melting. ZIF-77 is directly heated from 10 to 900 K using the same heating rate. The ZIF-4 sample is then quenched to 300 K within 12.5 ps using an NPT ensemble, to form a glass. For the ReaxFF, a tolerance of 10-6 for the charge equilibrium is used. The average pressure of the system is maintained at 1 atm. The sample contains 2176 atoms, 2368 atoms, and 3360 atoms for the ZIF-4, ZIF-62, and ZIF-77 simulations, respectively. In terms of computational cost, the melt-quench simulation (25 ps) for 2176 atoms can be
completed in about 1.5 h using 8 Intel Xeon processors (2.2 GHz) available in common workstations. Because of the low CPU-time cost, ReaxFF is suitable for simulating many ZIF materials that contain C, H, O, N, and Zn, and can be extended to cover other elements if needed. We note that in ref 10, because of the high computational cost of first-principles MD, the ZIF-glass model from reverse Monte Carlo modeling whose unit cell contains thousands of atoms cannot be directly simulated.

  At LC only two-thirds of the surface were covered by the deposited molecules, whereas in the other case the surface was almost saturated. The characteristics and dynamics of the adsorbates were studied at 300 K in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was regulated by means of the Berendsen thermostat, and the relaxation constant was set to 0.1 ps.
Considering that ReaxFF updates bond orders every time step, it was necessary to fix the time step at 0.25 fs. The equations of motion were solved with the Verlet leapfrog algorithm, and system configurations were sampled every 0.1 ps during the subsequent production period (900 ps). Short MD runs of 10 ps each, at 400 K, were periodically (once every 150 ps) carried out during the sampling phase in order to randomize the position of the adsorbates and explore different regions of the system configurational space. It is worth noting that these temperature jumps interrupted the continuity of the system dynamics.

  Given these premises, we built a molecular model consisting of one cysteine molecule, 303 waters, and a relatively large Au(111) slab (10 layers made of 90 Au atoms each) which was placed in a simulation box where the size was about 26 x 25 x70 in x, y, and z directions, respectively. The molecule was positioned close to the slab to avoid long sampling times and reactive MD simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble at T = 300 K and ambient pressure by means of the ReaxFF version incorporated into the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program. After the equilibration phase (25 ps), during which the molecule managed to get in touch with the surface orienting the S lone pairs toward the Au atoms (physisorption), the production phase started and system configurations were saved every 0.025 ps for a total simulation time of about 100 ps.
Temperature was controlled through the Berendsen thermostat with a relaxation constant of 0.1 ps, and the time step was set to 0.25 fs.

  In all cases the supercell had as many Al atoms as required to make the Cu/Al ratio equal to 0.5 (i.e., 4, 10, and 10 for simulation sets 1, 2, and 3, repsectively). All 3 sets of simulations were performed at six different starting temperatures: 100, 300, 500, 700, 900, and 1100 K. A short NPT run was performed first, at 1 atm pressure for all temperatures (progressively raising the temperature) to preoptimize the supercell sizes. The final structure from the NPT run for each temperature was then used as the starting structure in NVE simulations. The time step for integration was 0.25 fs. The total simulation time for each run was 500 ps (0.5 ns), or 2 million time steps. Because the reactive events in the simulations were only mildly exothermic, the temperatures throughout the simulations did not deviate much from their initial values (no more than 50 K). Thus, we can categorize the results according to the initial temperatures.

  The temperature-programmed (NVT)- MD simulations were performed using a velocity Verlet approach with a time step of 0.25 fs. A Berendsen thermostat with a damping constant of 100 fs was used for temperature control. Each MD simulation was initiated from an energy-minimized structure and was equilibrated to the simulation temperature by the thermostat prior to any reactive events being observed.

  All ReaxFF MD simulations were conducted in the NVT ensemble, where a Berendsen thermostat with a 500 fs damping constant was employed to maintain a system temperature of 300 K. An extended Ni surface surrounding the indentation site precludes lateral expansion, as the entire Ni slab would have to expand uniformly. Hence, simulations in the NVT ensemble are appropriate as they do not allow for the dissipation of surface stress by an unphysical uniform expansion of the entire Ni surface. Each simulation consisted of 70 000 MD iterations with a time step of 0.25 fs, yielding a total simulation time of 17.5 ps. In all simulations, the indenter tip was initially placed 17.6 Angstrom above the Ni surface and was lowered at a rate of 2.4 Angstrom/ps for the initial 35 000 iterations and was retracted at the same rate for the final 35 000 iterations. This yields a penetration depth of 3.4 Angstrom below the Ni surface, which corresponds to three Ni atomic layers. The position of the indenter was controlled via bond restraints between fixed dummy atoms (four placed above and two below the surface) and four carbon atoms at the indenter base and two at the tip. A total of six MD simulations were conducted, consisting of the three indenter models interacting with each of the two surface models, allowing for a comparative analysis of the various effects hydrogen and oxygen contaminates have on Ni-C interactions at the indenter-surface interface.

  MD simulations were performed to study the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to form formaldehyde and subsequent regeneration of the active site. These calculations used a time step of 0.25 fs with the temperature being controlled by a Berendsen thermostat with a temperature-damping constant of 0.1 ps.
To simulate the steps involved in the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, we started with the crystal structure of V2O5 which has cell parameters of a ) 3.564 Angstrom, b ) 11.519 Angstrom, and c ) 4.373 Angstrom. We then built a 6 x 2 supercell in the a and b directions and used a finite slab with three layers in the c direction, leading to a (001) surface. This slab, containing 504 atoms, was exposed on both surfaces to a gas phase containing 30 methanol molecules in a volume of 8211 Angstrom^3 , which would correspond to a methanol pressure of 0.16 GPa at 2000 K. First, we optimized the CH3OH/V2O5 system to minimize the energy.
Subsequent simulations of the reaction with methanol were carried out for 250 ps using a dual-temperature thermostat keeping the V and O atoms associated with the vanadium oxide slab at 650 K. while the C, O, and H atoms associated with the methanol molecules were kept at 2000 K. This temperature regime was maintained throughout the simulation and did not change when reactions occurred.
To follow the reaction events, molecular analysis of the simulations was performed using a bond order cutoff of 0.2 to allow detection of short-lived intermediates.

  MD simulations were carried out under the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble to simulate the volume change of MOFs as a function of water content at 300 K and 1 atm. The MD simulations were performed with a parallelized ReaxFF in LAMMPS,43 where a time step of 0.001 ps was used and the simulations were performed up to 2,000 ps. We also tested an effect of the MD time on water stability of the MOFs and found that collapse of the MOF structures induced by hydrolysis reactions were observed within 500 ps, which indicates that the MD time of 2000 ps considered in this work is sufficient for our conclusion.
  During the simulations, lattice parameters (a, b, c) were changed independently, while, the lattice angles (Éø, É¿, É¡) were fixed. To eliminate the boundary effects, an infinite threedimensional periodic simulation box was used with 1 x 1 x 1 unit cell for IRMOF-10, IRMOF-13 and IRMOF-14, 2 x 2 x 1 and 2 x 1 x1 supercells for SUMOF-4 and IRMOF-9, respectively. The lattice parameters of the MOFs are summarized in Supporting Information. The initial structures including MOFs and H2O molecules were constructed using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation with the universal force field (UFF) where the H2O molecules were randomly distributed in free volume of the MOFs.

  Our goal was to treat several layers of SiO2 reflecting differences between various SiC orientations. Therefore, we have simulated 1 ns oxide growth with 2 x 106 time steps using a 0.5 fs time step. The number of atoms involved in the simulations must be appropriately limited in order to be able to perform the desired number of time steps. On the other hand, the number of O2 molecules must be high enough to ensure a constant gas flow. For this reason, numerous control simulations have been performed with respect to various simulation box sizes to ensure that the product gases in the air do not further affect the oxidation and that an adequate number of O2 molecules is available at every time step of the simulation. Our initial structure setup consists of approximately 10 SiC layers in x and y directions and 27 SiC layers in the z direction. The space on top of the substrate is 3 times the height of the crystal with randomly and uniformly distributed O2 molecules, indicating dry air conditions for the thermal oxidation. The schematic representation of the 3 x 3 x 24 nm3 simulation box is shown in Figure 2. The total number of particles in all of the simulations was approximately 104, out of which about 3600 are Si and C atoms. The surfaces of SiC were not initially passivated, as the passivated surfaces could affect the investigation of the orientation dependence of the oxidation growth rates.43. All simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble, depending on the absolute temperature, number of particles, and volume (NVT). Periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions and a reflective boundary in the z direction were used to avoid undesired oxidation on the bottom of the substrate. The temperature of the simulations was controlled with the Berendsen thermostat with a temperature damping constant of 100 fs. We have performed simulations with four common industry-focused oxidation temperatures: T = 900, 1000, 1100, and 1200 ÅãC. In order to investigate orientation dependence, four different initial structures were prepared, which represent the four considered SiC faces, shown in Figure 3.

  The overall strategy is to augment the ReaxFF-2008 training set with energies and geometries of condensed phases and short-ranged energies and forces from the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) potential, which is widely used for modeling high-energy collisions. The ZBL energy values are included with weights inversely proportional to the energy. The ReaxFF potential parameters are refit as described below. Finally, the short-ranged repulsive wall is corrected by a tabulated functional form. Before discussing the fitting procedure, the issue of cutoff distance is addressed. The computational efficiency of a potential is linked with its cutoff distance as the number of interactions between atoms rises with the third power of the cutoff distance. The ReaxFF formalism utilizes three distinct cutoff distances,10 one for chemical bonds, one for the hydrogen bond term, and one for nonbonded interactions including both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. The values are virtually identical for all existing ReaxFF parametrizations, that is, 5, 7.5, and 10 Angstrom, for the three interactions, respectively.10,12,15 Even though the same cutoff distance is used for the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, one would expect that the cutoff distance for the van der Waals term should be shorter than that for the electrostatic term, which is not present in the ci-ReaxFF potential. The following procedure is employed in order to choose the new cutoff distance. A sample consisting of 63 É¿-carotene molecules is equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm in an NPT ensemble during an 83 ps simulation. The ReaxFF-lg potential12 is used because it allows one to extract explicitly the long-ranged van der Waals energies. When the van der Waals interaction energies of all atoms between 7 and 10 Angstrom are set to zero, the energy change is 1 x 10^-2 kcal/mol (1%) and 8 x 10^-4 kcal/mol (0.2%) for C and H atoms, respectively. We consider this a negligible change and thus will use a cutoff distance of 7 Angstrom for the ci-ReaxFF potential. This reduction in cutoff distance eliminates 2/3 of the neighbors, a substantial reduction in computational effort.

  In this first study, in line with the experimental needs, we have focused on the interaction of two representative species from catalytic fractionation with a heterogeneous palladium surface: (i) dimeric species MOL1 comprising the É¿-O-4Åå bond and (ii) highly reactive monophenolic compound MOL2 (Figure 2). In (i) we have studied the Pd-catalyzed C-O bond cleavage and in (ii) we have studied the reduction of the double bond. These transformations are key processes in the catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. The model reactor was built by combining the equilibrated solvent boxes containing the solutes (eight molecules in a 82 x 82 x 76 Angstrom^3 solvent box), which were extracted from the RMD trajectories of MOL1 and MOL2 in methanol-water solution, with a Pd(111) (10 layers of 90 atoms) or Pd(100) (15 layers of 50 atoms) slab (box sizes: 25.9 x 25.9 x 70 Angstrom^3 or 19.4 x 25.9 x 70 Angstrom^3) by placing the solvent + solute boxes on top of the slabs in such a way that one of the solute molecules was accommodated close to the metal (at a distance of about 3.5 Angstrom). This was required to avoid long sampling times. Then, the resulting boxes were appropriately cut and reshaped to match the metal slab dimensions. RMD simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble at T = 453 K by means of the ReaxFF/ADF program. Configurations were saved every 0.05 ps for a maximum simulation time of about 200 ps. Temperature was controlled through the BerendsenÅfs thermostat with a relaxation constant of 0.1 ps, and the time step was set to 0.25 fs. More than 200 simulations were carried out for describing the adsorption of MOL1 and MOL2 on both slabs in  ethanol-water solution, and only the most profitable results are reported and commented on in this manuscript. In all cases, after an equilibration time (about 25 ps) the molecules reached the surface by, first, extending the side chains toward the Pd atoms and, then, if the surrounding environment was favorable (i.e., the surface was not occupied by the solvent), adsorbing the aromatic rings, which were promptly chemisorbed. Indeed, the dominant interactions were those related to bond terms between the carbon atoms and the Pd sites.

  This process was also identified by employing ReaxFF-MD simulations. For our simulation, a total of 3 OH species were formed after 700 ps. One of them moved to the YSZ surface near TPB with the distances of 2.7 and 2.1 Angstrom from the nearest Ni and Zr atoms, respectively. The other two OH species gradually moved toward the Ni(220) surface sites, which was specified as the OH spillover or back-transfer in the kinetic study by Goodwin et al. In contrast, the OH spillover process was not favorable according to the above-mentioned DFT calculations, while it was not perceived in the ReaxFFMD simulations.

  All atomistic simulations are performed with the proposed ReaxFF parameter set implemented in the ADF Modeling Suite. The initial structure of MIL-140C is the DFT optimized geometry reported elsewhere. We use the Berendsen thermostat with a damping constant of 100 fs and the Berendsen barostat with a damping constant of 1500 fs for all presented simulations. We chose a 0.25 fs time step and the periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions. To test the proposed ReaxFF parameter set against the physical properties of MIL-140C, a constant pressure simulation (NPT) at a temperature (T = 300 K) and atmospheric pressure (P = 1 atm) is initially performed. An average density obtained from this NPT simulations is 1.097 g/cm3 (seen in Figure 1(a)), whereas the experimental density is about 1.23 g/cm3, indicating about 10% discrepancy. This density remains stable over the longer simulation time that is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The cell angle (É¿ = 85.02Åã) after 150 ps NPT simulation remains similar to the starting DFT structure (É¿ = 84.51Åã). A detailed comparison of cell parameters with previously reported MIL-140C structures (experiments and simulations) is included in the Supporting Information. To emulate thermal degradation of this system, we applied the following simulation scenario. The equilibrated system (150 ps at 300 K) is first heated to 2000 K at a rate of 2 K/ps and is followed by a short (50 ps) constant temperature simulation at 2000 K. Then, the system is cooled to 300 K at a rate of 4 K/ps. This decomposed MOF is kept at constant temperature (T = 300 K) for an extra 50 ps, so the structural changes of the Zr-O clusters can be assessed. To ensure the consistency of the simulation, we extracted the two statistically different initial configurations (after 100 and 110 ps equilibration at 300 K) and subjected these initial structures to the same heating and cooling regime. Both configurations resulted in a similar decomposition behavior to the structure after the 150 ps equilibration discussed in this work (see Supporting Information, section 2). Additionally, the structures of MIL-140C at 600 K and 800 K are extracted from the simulation trajectory during the heating stage and subjected to 100 ps constant temperature simulations. While the MIL-140C framework remains stable at 600 K, some of the organic linkers were observed to dissociate from the zirconia nodes at 800 K. This observation agrees with the experimentally observed degradation temperature to be around 700 to 800 K. Nevertheless, thermal degradation of the MOF measured in minutes/hours is not accessible for MD simulation times (measured in nanoseconds), so all simulations reported here are performed at relatively higher temperatures that enable us to observe more reactions in a shorter time.

  To validate and apply the current ReaxFF description for the aluminum/oxygen system, two structures were prepared in this work: 504 Al atoms of Al (4 3 1) slab (1.40 x 1.28 x 4.82 nm, see Figure 1a) and 864 Al atoms of an amorphous Al cluster (diameter of 2.8 nm, see Figure 1b). The system configurations were displayed by the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) molecular graphics viewer, Visit, and Molden. The slab was built by cleaving the (4 3 1) plane of fcc-Al crystal and then by placing the slab in a 1.4 x 1.28 x 10.0 nm simulation box with 150 oxygen molecules. The amorphous cluster was obtained by annealing the fcc-Al crystal containing 864 Al atoms from 0 to 800 K for two cycles. Then, the annealed cluster was placed in the middle of a simulation box that measured 5.0 x 5.0 x 5.0 nm. Two different numbers of oxygen gas, that is, 300 and 600 oxygen molecules, were distributed randomly in the simulation box with a periodic boundary condition, corresponding to oxygen gas densities of 0.13 and 0.26 g/cm3, respectively. For the ReaxFF-MD simulations to deal with chemical reactions to occur smoothly, it has been reported that the time step needs to be lower than 1 order of the highest frequency of molecules (generally, t = 0.5 - 1.0 fs). In this study, the system temperature was controlled up to 900 K, and it was found that the time step of 0.2 fs efficiently describes the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion of oxygen molecules. Hence, all the simulations were performed with a time step of 0.2 fs and 5 000 000 iterations (up to 1.0 ns). Because this study was focused mainly on the oxidation of ANPs as a function of the temperature of the system, it was essential to control the temperature of the system during the MD simulations. For this reason, a canonical ensemble was used, that is, a constant number of atoms, constant volume, and constant temperature. In the canonical ensemble, a variety of thermostatic methods were used to control the temperature of the system, such as Nose/Hoover, Berendsen, and Anderson. It has been suggested that the Nose/Hoover thermostat correctly describes the canonical ensemble with true dynamics, because such a method makes it possible to obtain a canonical distribution of the particlesÅf positions and momenta by using the extended Hamiltonian system. Hence, we chose to use the Nose/ Hoover thermostat with a temperature damping constant of 100 fs implemented on the 29 Jan 2014 version of LAMMPS code41 (http://lammps.sandia.gov). In addition, the 864 atoms of the ANPs were heated from 0 to 1000 K with a heating rate of 0.02 K/fs to evaluate the melting temperature of the ANPs using the current ReaxFF description. The melting temperature of the 864 atoms of the ANPs is found to be about 800 K; the result is summarized in the Supporting Information.

  The equilibrated GC-MC structures obtained here serve as surface models for subsequent reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations of methane activation, as they approximate the thermodynamically stable surface morphology under reaction conditions. We employed RMD simulations of methane activation to assess relative activation rates over varying cluster/support interfacial morphologies. A temperature-programmed RMD scheme was used to simulate methane lightoff, where 30 CH4 molecules were placed randomly in the simulation box above the surface (trajectory videos and coordinates are provided in the Supporting Information). Note that no O2 molecules are included in the gas phase, as it assumed that the surface has already been equilibrated with the O2 environment via the GC-MC simulations used to derive the initial geometries. To simulate light-off behavior, the system thermostat was ramped from 750 K to 1750 K over the course of the 50 ps simulation. To monitor methane activation, populations of molecular species were recorded at 25 fs intervals (Figure 3). Methane activation at about 1440 K is marked by a sharp decrease in the number of gas phase CH4 molecules accompanied by an increase in adsorbed H atoms, indicating dissociative methane adsorption (Figure 3a). Partial combustion products (such as CHO, CH2O, and CO) appear on the surface as intermediate species, along with total combustion products (H2O and CO2) appearing in the gas phase. Figure 3b compares methane lightoff over Pd and PdOx clusters that are both supported on and embedded in the CeO2 lattice. Control simulations over pristine CeO2(111) resulted in no CH4 activation events. Methane activation occurs more readily over the supported metallic cluster, compared to the embedded cluster, where C-H activation occurs at undercoordinated Pd atoms near the edges of the cluster. Such sites are less accessible to CH4 in the embedded model, leading to slower methane activation. This trend is reversed over the oxidized clusters, where embedded PdOx achieves faster activation compared to the supported cluster. Since the number of exposed edge sites decreases when the cluster is embedded, enhanced activation over embedded PdOx must reflect uniquely active sites created by PdOx/CeO2 mixing at the interface (Figure 3c).
