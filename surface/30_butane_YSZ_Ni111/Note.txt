For ffield.reax.CHONSSiPtZrNiCuCoYBa
(The original "ReaxFF" file lists two Zr. So I deleted the second Zr column. I don't know if this is correct. Ba may not work. )

The Ni/YSZ ReaxFF developed by combining the YSZ and Ni/C/H descriptions and defining the missing angular terms from combination rules. Ni-Zr and Ni-Y bonded interactions were ignored; Ni/Y and Ni/Zr non-bonded parameters were obtained from combination rules.
