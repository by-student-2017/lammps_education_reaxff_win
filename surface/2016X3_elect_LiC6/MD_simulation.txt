  The anode half-cell of a LiMn2O4 based battery is simulated using ReaxFF based molecular dynamics. A lithiated graphite anode is exposed to and electrolyte consisting of 3:7 mole ratio117 of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the electrolyte solvents, 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte salt, and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte additive. The electrolyte molecules react with Li atoms from the anode, resulting in the formation of compounds that comprise the SEI layer on the surface of the anode.
  Figure 3.1 shows the simulation cell that measures about 15 nm x 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm. The graphite slab with dimension 7 nm x 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm is located in the middle of the simulation cell and the rest of the simulation cell is filled with 208 EC molecules, 480 DMC molecules, 40 FEC molecules and 60 LiPF6 molecules, which results in an equilibrium electrolyte density of 1.26 g/cc. This configuration helps with maintaining periodic boundary conditions in all three directions without any discontinuities. Bulk electrolyte character is maintained at distances greater than 3 nm from the anode surfaces even after 2 ns, the maximum time period in this study.
  The simulation cells were maintained at 303 K under the NVT ensemble using the Nose Hoover thermostat with a temperature rescaling constant of 10 fs. The starting configuration of the electrolyte molecules was generated using the PACKMOL118 code to make sure short range repulsive forces do not disrupt the simulation. Each MD simulation was initiated from an energy-minimized structure and was equilibrated to the simulation temperature for 100 ps prior to the production run for 1 ns with a 0.2 fs time step.

Figure 3.1 The starting configuration of the simulation cell with the anode in the center exposed to the electrolyte on both surfaces. The simulation box plane into the paper measures 3.5 nm x 3.5 nm. Lithiated graphite is used as the anode, 3:7 mol/mol mixture of EC and DMC as the electrolyte, 1M LiPF6 as the salt and 5% FEC as the electrolyte additive.
