# define collective variables based on different distances (not all variables are used for the metadynamics simulation. See Table 1 of the main text)
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=85,113 # N-C (the characteristic distance between -NH2 and CO2)
d3: DISTANCE ATOMS=114,7 # O-H (i.e., the O-H distance between the proton from -NH2 and one oxygen in CO2)
d4: DISTANCE ATOMS=85,7 # N-H (i.e., one of the N-H distances between the hydrogen nitrogen in -NH2)
d34: CUSTOM ARG=d3,d4 VAR=x,y PERIODIC=NO FUNC=x+y # d34 is used to avoid a large distance of the proton from both the C atom in CO2 and the N atom in -NH2

# define additional distance-based collective variables to avoid irrelevant bond formation or breaking.
d11: DISTANCE ATOMS=85,8 # N-H (the other N-H bond in -NH2)
d12: DISTANCE ATOMS=7,115  # H-O (distance between the proton and the other O atom in CO2)
d13: DISTANCE ATOMS=7,112  # H-O (there is another O atom for which the proton may form an unwanted bond)

rA: RMSD REFERENCE=./sa.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL  # sa.pdb contains the positions of atoms from -NH2 and CO2 (C,H,O,N) which are close the adsorption site in the unadsorbed configruation; an example is provided.
rB: RMSD REFERENCE=./sb.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL  # sb.pdb contains the positions of atoms from -NH2 and CO2 (C,H,O,N) which are close the adsorption site in the adsorbed configruation; and example is provided.

# Empirical walls are used to either enhance sampling of the CO2 chemisorption or prevent unwanted reactions
